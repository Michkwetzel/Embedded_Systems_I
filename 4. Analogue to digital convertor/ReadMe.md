# Analogue to digital convertor and External interrupts

In this practical you are going build a simple voltage data logger using the Analogue to Digital Convertor.

## Task
In this practical you will be simulate a basic battery monitoring circuit on your UCT STM32F0 Devel- opment Board. Data loggers are devices that read data in and store that data in a memory. The data can then be retrieved from the logger at a later stage. This logger will only have four memory slots. The incoming data will come from the potentiometer POT0. You will need to write the program in C to simulate this system and then run it on the UCT STM32 Development Board.
